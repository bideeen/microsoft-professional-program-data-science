keep a changelog for humans 

## 2018-05-22
ADDED 
- .github folder 
- I want to make this accessable for modification by others :) 

## ORIGIN 2018-05-21 
I wish I had notes from the data science course I took a couple of years ago....
I can just collect everything in one repo! This will be that repo. 

#### Added 
- folder for each course
- links to other repos for courses (particularly mine)
- content so that gitbook doesn't convert each directory to a file

#### Created 
- this 
- gitbook https://mpp-data-science.gitbook.io/project/
